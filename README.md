ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaraProchy
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming; itâ€™s my hobby and a pastime that I enjoy in my free time. Programming has become increasingly fascinating to me, and I want to improve in it.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Low-code programming language. I started with Swift, and then I moved on to web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m on parental leave, taking care of my 3-year-old son. Since heâ€™s very active, I donâ€™t have much free time ðŸ˜„
